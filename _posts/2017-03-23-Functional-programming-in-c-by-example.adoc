= Functional programming in c++ by example
:hp-tags: c++, functional

Functional programming (*FP*) is popular these days. Articles, books, blogs. Every conference has a couple of talks about the beauty of functional approach. I looked at it from the side for a long time and now I want to try it in practice. After I dug a lot through the theory I decided to write a small application in a functional style. I'll take a code from my https://nikitablack.github.io/2017/02/02/Data-Oriented-Design-by-example.html[previous article] so the example will be a 2D physics simulation.
