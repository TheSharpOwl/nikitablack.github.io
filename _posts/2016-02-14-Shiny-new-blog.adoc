= Shiny new blog
:hp-tags: other

I like programming. Really like. I like how you can combine words in your favorite programming language and put life into software. I'm programming a lot - on my work, in my free time. That's why I feel competent to start to write about it. But this blog is created for me. I found that when I'm trying to explain some topic with simple words I'm understanding it better. So basically things I'm gonna to write here is for future me - nothing should be lost and nothing should be left without understanding.

I have a http://volgogradetzzz.blogspot.com/[another blog] already but I moved away from flash (thought still love it and always read latest news about the platform) and it's time to write about something different, more advanced maybe. My current language is `c++` and I like it. A lot. I lkie computer graphics and I'll try to cover this topics mostly.  I don't like https://www.blogger.com/home[Blogger] platform that's why I decided to move to other blog engine. https://pages.github.com/[Github pages] and static pages are great. It's fast and simple. With http://hubpress.io/[Hubpress] you can create good looking blog in minutes.
